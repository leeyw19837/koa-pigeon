# pigeon

## Getting started

```bash
git clone http://github.com/ihealthlab/pigeon && cd pigeon && yarn
yarn build
yarn watch
open http://localhost:3080/graphql
```

## Problem domain

GTZH database structure has inconsistencies and naming issues.

## Intention

1. redesign foot assessment
1. redesign the data strucutre in graphql
1. refactor the database and the code.

If successful then repeat for other groups of forms


## Questions

* Should use enums for normal abnormal rather than boolean?
* Should refactor left and right data into a different form factor?
